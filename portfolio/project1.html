					<h3>Social Media Video</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						During Fall Quarter, I decided to take this course with Craig
						Duff as I had always been interested in video work. At this time,
						we were under COVID rules and regulations, and I was
						one of the few students who was taking the class remotely. Despite
						my worries, I was able to take advantage of my hometown, and with
						the equipment Prof. Duff was able to send to me, I was able to create
						entertaining videos.
					</p>

					<p>
						We were tasked with producing two longer-form videos by the middle and
						end of the quarter. Our first project was to create an explainer-style video,
						and after pitching various ideas, I decided to do mine on the urge to
						reopen the Disneyland in Anaheim. I shot in-person footage myself at a rally
						that had taken place the weekend before, created engaging animations and 
						interviewed key stakeholders for the story. For our final project, I also
						created a longer explainer-style video about finding love under COVID conditions.
						In order to break up the interviews and animations, I brainstormed ideas for b-roll by creating
						simple stop motions and filming friends.

					<p>
						Once I storyboarded, I went ahead with contacting sources that I found
						on various social media channels like a Disney fanpage on Facebook and
						app developers on TikTok. For b-roll, I created animations on Adobe After
						Effects after creating graphics on Adobe Illustrator. All in all, it was
						quite a labor-intensive project, but I was always very happy with the
						videos I had produced.

						Since this course, I became more interested in producing and editing video coursework.
						I continued my efforts to better my skills in video by partaking in The Daily Northwestern
						and have offered up this skillset at various internships. I reached out to the Art Director
						at Vox Media and heard about their journey, and now I aspire to also produce similar
						explainer-style videos in my career.
